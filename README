libbase64

This is the OpenBSD base64 functions extracted to an external static library. It
provides an easy way to include base64 encoding and decoding in your code. It has
been updated to C99, and uses the C99 standard integer type uint8_t.

UNIT TESTS
The following unit tests ship with the library:

* A version check to ensure the library being tested matches what is
  expected, and that the version function works as expected.
* An encoding length test that validates the base64_enclen function.
* A decoding length test that validates the base64_declen function.
* An encoding test that tests increases length of a string with the
  expected output string. This function builds increasingly longer
  strings of A's (i.e. 'A', 'AA', etc...) and validates against an
  array of expected base64 strings.
* A decoding test that ensures the that the previous test vectors
  decode to the expected sequence.
